ðŸ”„ Lets you sync secrets across multiple repositories \
ðŸ”Ž Use the GitHub Search syntax with a `query` input

## Usage

First, you'll need a [PAT]. The default `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` doesn't
have access to set secrets on other repositories. You'll need to [create a PAT]
with access to the "secrets" permission either for a single repo, multiple
repos, or all repos.

Then, put something like this in a "dummy" repository that will hold a bunch of
secrets. I like to use my community health file repository (`jcbhmr/.github`)
for this. You can also use this with something like `on: push` if you want to
set secrets dynamically, but I think the most prevelant use case is to sync
secret values across multiple repositories. ðŸ˜Š

```yml
name: Update user secrets
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/update-user-secrets.yml
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:
concurrency:
  group: update-user-secrets
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  update-user-secrets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: jcbhmr/set-secrets-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.USER_SECRETS_TOKEN }}
          repositories: |
            jcbhmr/awesome-project
            jcbhmr/nodejs-cool
            jcbhmr/todo-app
            jcbhmr/wiki-thing
          secrets: |
            NPM_TOKEN=${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
            VERCEL_TOKEN=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

ðŸ’¡ It's recommended to run this action on a `cron: "0 0 * * *"` or similar
schedule so that any changes to the `${{ secrets.* }}` values is reflected on
the synced repos soon-ish. You can use [crontab guru] to derive cron expressions
from human-readable descriptions.

You can also use a dynamic GitHub Search query to set secrets on multiple
repositories. For instance, you could use `user:${{ github.repository_owner }}`
and `tag:nodejs` to set secrets on all of your Node.js repositories!

```yml
- uses: jcbhmr/set-secrets-action@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.USER_SECRETS_TOKEN }}
    query: user:${{ github.repository_owner }} tag:nodejs
    secrets: |
      NPM_TOKEN=${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      VERCEL_TOKEN=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

â„¹ We will **always** auto-exclude the current repository from the list of
repositories to set secrets on. This is to prevent you from accidentally setting
secrets on the repository that is running the action.

### Inputs

- **`token`:** The GitHub PAT to use when setting secrets on other repos. You
  can't use the default secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN for this since it only covers the
  current repository. You'll need to create a PAT with access to the "secrets"
  permission either for a single repo, multiple repos, or all repos. This is
  required.

- **`github-server-url`:** The GitHub server URL to use when setting secrets on
  other repos. This defaults to the GitHub server URL that the action is running
  on. Defaults to the github.server_url context variable.

- **`dry-run`:** Whether or not to actually set the secrets. Set this to true
  when testing this action. Defaults to false.

- **`repository`:** The repository to set the secrets on. This is required if
  you don't set either "repositories" or "query". You must set at least one of
  "repository", "repositories", or "query".

- **`repositories`:** A newline-separated list of repositories to set the
  secrets on. You must set at least one of "repository", "repositories", or
  "query".

- **`query`:** A GitHub Search query to find repositories to set the secrets on.
  You must set at least one of "repository", "repositories", or "query". This
  input is useful if you want to dynamically expand the list of repositories to
  set secrets on based on some criteria like "tag:nodejs" to auto-set the
  NPM_TOKEN secret on all Node.js repos.

- **`app`:** Either "actions", "codespaces", or "dependabot". You can set
  secrets on only one context at a time. The default is "actions" which is
  probably what you want.

- **`secret`:** A name-value pair like "HELLO_WORLD=hello". You must set at
  least one of "secret" or "secrets".

- **`secrets`:** A newline-separated list of name-value pairs like
  "HELLO_WORLD=hello". You must set at least one of "secret" or "secrets".
